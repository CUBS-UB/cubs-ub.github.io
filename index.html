    <div class="text-justify">
      <p>The Center for Unified Biometrics and Sensors (CUBS) was established in October 2003 with the mission of advancing the science of biometric technologies for both civilian and homeland security applications by integrating pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms with sensors technology. The mission of the Center is to advance the scientific underpinnings of biometric technologies for both civilian and homeland security applications by integrating pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms with sensors technology. Dr. Venu Govindaraju, SUNY Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, is its founding director. CUBS research and development activities in machine learning span two strategic application areas, biometrics and language technologies. The activities range from research on Department of Defense projects and developing prototype devices for the industry, to organizing major technical conferences and training graduate students. CUBS projects are funded by industry and government agencies. Federal sponsors include the Army Research Labs, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National Science Foundation. Industry sponsors include BBN Raytheon, Google, HP, IBM, and Lockheed Martin. CUBS organizes premiere conferences and workshops in both the areas of Document Recognition and Retrieval and Biometrics under the auspices of the International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>
